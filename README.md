We are primarily looking at the way you approach the problem, and the way you organize your code. Enjoy!

The first task is essential, and oft overlooked as an important and difficult quality of advanced engineering. Spend some preliminary drawing board time, even if just a few minutes, to break this small assessment into smaller pieces, and estimate how long each will take you. Commit a CSV with that information as your first commit. Time yourself carefully. Update this file as time goes on, with a new column showing logged time so it can be compared to the initial guess. Even good engineers are bad at this sometimes, because of the notoriously unknowable nature of unknown unknowns. Again, we are looking at your process, and promise we will not be phased by poor estimates.

The assessment: 
You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic society, joining a team of rogue ninja engineers that desperately need to keep track of their tasks. However, much of the internet was erased by electromagnetic pulse, precluding the use of pre-built components such as react-trello. Your task is to build a kanban board from scratch: 
1. Use the png provided as a wireframe template, and create a list of 4 boards with 2 default items in each list.
2. Create the functionality to add a task to each list.
3. Create the functionality to drag items from one list to another.
4. Persist items in the browser.
5. Style the board according to your personal taste
6. Find the checkmate in one in chess_puzzle.png, and hardcode your answer somewhere in the kanban board (you can simply write the move out, draw an arrow over  the board, or indicate the answer in any way you see fit). This is a question about attention to detail- double check your answer is correct before submitting.
